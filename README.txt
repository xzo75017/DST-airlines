The file lufthansa.py contains the functions to collect data from the 
lufthansa API.

At the current state of progress, the file includes the following 
features:

- get_country (Access_Token)
- get_cities(Access_Token)
- get_airports (Access_Token)
- get_aircrafts(Access_Token)

To get data, you need to call the appropriate function and give it as 
argument your access key to the Lufthansa API.
